In BA_perform_FBA.py the code for the application of the FBA can be found. 
Most of the functions for formatting the matrix into the form accepted by the solver can be found in function_outsourcing.

BA_perform_Gene_Knockout.py provides the used code for the gene knockout analysis.

The model can be found in Examples\Actual_Matrix.xlsx. 
The used reactions for the construction of the model are provided in model_reactions\Flux_equations_CyVersion.
For a better overview, the names of the reactants together with the KEGG annotation were combined in the file reactants_name_and_coNumbersCyVersion.pdf.
